# my-portfolio

Thank you for visiting my portfolio!

Here you will find all of my projects that i was developing during my bootcamp studying. 

During this course i've learned how to create menu bar, how to make sctructure of any page, using proper tags, creating styles for html tags and of course creating static web pages in general.

I started my website with only css and html however as i was going through my education i was able add some modification and compleciti to my code. 

I hope you will like it. Thank you!
