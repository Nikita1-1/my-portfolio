# my-portfolio

Thank you for visiting my portfolio!

Here you will find all of my projects that i was developing during my bootcamp studying. 

In this repository you will find projects as: <br>
 <strong><h1>My own website</h1></strong> <br>
 Website made with HTML and CSS code only, using advanced tags like <strong> opacity, z-index, @keyframe, before, after, @media and much more. </strong>. 
 I will continue improving my website.<br>
 
 <strong><h1> Coffee Launge Website & Iphone website</h1><strong><br>
 This website was one of my initial of many other projects from bootcamp, where i had to learn how to make hover effect, structure of webpage, how display work. As well as how to create a navbar and attache a background picture. I did enjoy look for bugs that i have made and of course the whole process of creating the websites.
 
 
I still continue educate myself with new techniques of how to use css to make website work faster, and how to write code less but more effective. 

I hope you will like it. Thank you!
